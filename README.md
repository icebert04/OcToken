# Introducing OcToken
> The **"Safest"** Yield Farm ever built in South East Asia

With the use of
* Solidity
* Truffle
* Ganache
* Metamask

I built a decentralized application under the Ethereum blockchain.

With the help of Ganache, a local in-memory blockchain designed for development & testing, any user can fund their crypto in replace of our governance token **(Octoken)**.

See image below...

In a sense, anyone is free to stake their tokens and earn from our Yield Farm without being rug pulled.

> **Disclaimer**  This repo is only for show purposes and it's not used for productivity. However, anyone can fork this for their own yield farm app purposes.

In the front-end, I did a few CSS and tweak a little of React to make the app a little more user friendly base and appealing to the potential users.

All in all, this repo could be a springboard to success to anyone who wants to profit in the DeFi space.
